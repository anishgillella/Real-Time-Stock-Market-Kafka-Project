Real-Time Stock Market Data Analysis Using Apache Kafka
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time stock market data analysis system using Apache Kafka, AWS services, and Python. The system simulates real-time stock market data, streams it through Kafka, stores it in Amazon S3, and allows for querying and analysis using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.

Project Structure
/kafka/: Contains scripts and configurations for setting up and running Apache Kafka and Zookeeper on an EC2 instance.
/data/: Contains the initial stock market dataset used for simulation.
/scripts/: Python scripts to simulate real-time data production, consumption, and storage.
/aws/: Scripts and configurations for interacting with AWS services such as S3, Glue, and Athena.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup and use.
Prerequisites
A machine with Python 3.5+ installed.
An AWS account with access to EC2, S3, Glue, and Athena.
Basic knowledge of Python, AWS services, and Apache Kafka.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-stock-analysis.git
cd real-time-stock-analysis

3. Install Required Python Packages
Navigate to the /scripts/ directory and install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Apache Kafka
EC2 Instance Setup: Launch an EC2 instance on AWS and SSH into the instance.
Kafka and Zookeeper Installation: Follow the instructions in the /kafka/ directory to install and configure Kafka and Zookeeper.
Start Zookeeper and Kafka: Use the provided scripts to start Zookeeper and Kafka on the EC2 instance.

4. Simulate Real-Time Stock Data
Run the data_producer.py script in the /scripts/ directory to simulate and produce real-time stock data into Kafka:

bash
Copy code
python data_producer.py
5. Consume and Store Data
Run the data_consumer.py script to consume the data from Kafka and store it in an Amazon S3 bucket:

bash
Copy code
python data_consumer.py
6. Catalog Data with AWS Glue
Set up a Glue Crawler as per the instructions in the /aws/ directory to catalog the data stored in S3.
Ensure the crawler runs and populates the Glue Data Catalog.

7. Query Data Using Amazon Athena
Use the SQL queries provided in the /aws/athena_queries/ directory to query the data cataloged by AWS Glue through Amazon Athena.

Challenges Faced
Kafka Connectivity Issues: Resolved by configuring Kafka to use the public IP of the EC2 instance.
Server Overload: Mitigated by adjusting data production rates and scaling the EC2 instance.
Data Latency: Addressed by optimizing the network setup and employing data batching techniques.
Alternate Approaches
AWS Kinesis: Managed real-time data streaming with less control over the process.
Microservices with Kubernetes: Offers better scalability but increases system complexity.
Serverless Architecture with AWS Lambda: Easier to scale but may introduce latency.
Google Cloud Pub/Sub and BigQuery: Easier management but limited to Google Cloud.
Apache Hadoop: Efficient for batch processing but not ideal for real-time data.


Conclusion
This project showcases the use of Apache Kafka and AWS services for real-time data streaming and analysis. By following the setup instructions, users can replicate the system and explore real-time data processing for various applications.
